### Reactive Programming

* **Reactive Programming** is an `asynchronous programming paradigm` concerned with `data streams` and the `propagation of change`.

### RX

* **ReactiveX** or **Rx** is the most popular API for **Reactive programming**
* **Rx** built on the ideals of the `Observable Pattern`, `Iterator Pattern`, and `Functional Programming`
* `Rx` is based on:
  * Observables
  * Observers : Observer essentially subscribes to an Observable
  * Operators: Operators allow you to transform, combine, manipulate, and work with the sequences of items emitted by Observables
