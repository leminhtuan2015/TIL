### What is Design Pattern


### Types of patterns

* Creational - abstraction of instantiation process
  * These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
  
    * Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes
    * Builder : Separates object construction from its representation
    * Factory Method : Creates an instance of several derived classes
    * Object Pool : Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
    * Prototype : A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
    * Singleton : A class of which only a single instance can exist
  
* Structural - composition of classes and objects in formation of larger structures
  * These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
    * Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes
    * Bridge: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
    * Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
    * Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
    * Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
    * Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
    * Private Class Data : Restricts accessor/mutator access
    * Proxy: An object representing another object


* Behavioral - abstraction of algorithms and assignment of responsibility between objects
