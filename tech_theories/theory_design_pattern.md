### What is Design Pattern
### Object oriented programming Design Pattern vs Functional Programming Design Pattern
### Types of patterns

------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is Design Pattern
* It's not language
* A design pattern is not a class or a library
* A design pattern is a **principle theory** in programming
* Design patterns are, by principle, well-thought out solutions to programming problems. Many programmers have encountered these problems before, and have used these 'solutions' to remedy them. If you encounter these problems, why recreate a solution when you can use an already proven answer?

### Object oriented programming Design Pattern vs Functional Programming Design Pattern
* **OOP Design Pattern very different with FP Design Pattern**
* Design patterns are very popular in **Java** and **C#** can be applied in all **object oriented languanges**
* In **functional oriented languages** like **Scala**, certain patterns are **not necesary anymore**.

### Types of patterns

* **`Creational`** - abstraction of instantiation process
  * These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
  
    * **Abstract Factory**: Creates an instance of several families of classes
    * **Builder** : Separates object construction from its representation
    * **Factory Method** : Creates an instance of several derived classes
    * **Object Pool** : Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
    * **Prototype** : A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
    * **Singleton** : A class of which only a single instance can exist
  
* **`Structural`** - composition of classes and objects in formation of larger structures
  * These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
    * **Adapter**: Match interfaces of different classes
    * **Bridge**: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
    * **Composite**: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
    * **Decorator**: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
    * **Facade**: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
    * **Flyweight**: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
    * **Private Class Data** : Restricts accessor/mutator access
    * **Proxy**: An object representing another object


* **`Behavioral`** - abstraction of algorithms and assignment of responsibility between objects
  * These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.
    * **Chain of responsibility** : A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
    * **Command** : Encapsulate a command request as an object
    * **Interpreter**: A way to include language elements in a program
    * **Iterator** : Sequentially access the elements of a collection
    * **Mediator**: Defines simplified communication between classes
    * **Memento**: Capture and restore an object's internal state
    * **Null Object**: Designed to act as a default value of an object
    * **Observer**: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
    * **State**: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
    * **Strategy**: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
    * **Template** method: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
    * **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a class without change
