# 1. Overview.
  - Swift (programming language) designed by *Apple Inc*.
  - Swift is an opensource tool under Apache 2.0 license.
  - First appeared:	June 2, 2014.
  - It is a *compiled programming language*.
  - Paradigm: Swift use multi-paradigm
    - Protocol-oriented programming.
    - object-oriented.
    - functional.
  -  Swift is intended as a replacement for C-based languages (C, C++, and Objective-C).
#### Design patterns
- IOS frameworks rely on design patterns such as model-view-controller and delegation in their implementation
- The first thing to notice is that **iOS apps** use a model-view-controller architecture

#### Features
  - Memory is managed automatically.
  - Supports inferred types.
```
  int i;    // declare type
  var i;    // inferred-type
```
  - Dont need semicolons (*;*) at the end of each line code.
  - Closures unified with function pointers.
  - Tuples and multiple return values.
  - Generics.
  - Functional programming patterns, e.g., map and filter.

#### Projects
  - The Swift language is managed as a collection of project.
    - *Swift compiler* command line tool. (Responsible for translating Swift source code into efficient, executable machine code)
    - *Standard library* bundled as part of the language.
    - *Core libraries* that provide higher-level functionality.
    - *LLDB debugger* which includes the Swift REPL.
    - *Swift package manager* for distributing and building Swift source code.
