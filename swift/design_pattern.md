## iOS frameworks design patterns

  - iOS frameworks rely on design patterns such as model-view-controller and delegation in their implementation
  
  - `Model:`
      - Data Objects
  - `View`
      - UIWindown
      - UI Objects
  - `Controller`
      - UIAppication
          - The UIApplication object manages the event loop and other high-level app behaviors.
      - ViewController
      - ApplicationDelegate 
          - The app delegate is the heart of your custom code. This object works in tandem with the UIApplication object to handle app initialization, state transitions, and many high-level app events.
