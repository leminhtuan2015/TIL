## Entry point (The Main Function)
  @UIApplicationMain statement in AppDelegate.Swift creates a implicit entry point for Swift program
  - The swift Book says: "Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you donâ€™t need a main function".
  - If you have a look at your AppDelegate there is a marker @UIApplicationMain which is outside of any scope and considered as entry point.
