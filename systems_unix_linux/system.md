### 0. History of OS
 - **1970s** **Unix** developed starting at the Bell Labs (of AT&T) research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie
   - Unix us close source
   - For commercial
 - **1969** Linus Torvalds is born.
 -  **11/03/1971** First edition of **Unix** released The first edition of the "Unix PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL [by] K. Thompson [and] D. M. Ritchie." It includes over 60 commands like
   - b (compile B program);
   - boot (reboot system); 
   - cat (concatenate files); 
   - chdir (change working directory); 
   - chmod (change access mode); 
   - chown (change owner); 
   - cp (copy file); 
   - ls (list directory contents); 
   - mv (move or rename file); 
   - roff (run off text); 
   - wc (get word count); 
   - who (who is one the system). 
   - The main thing missing was pipes.
   
 - **1983** The GNU project is first announced by Richard Stallman September 27, 1983
     - GNU = GNU's not Unix
     - The aim of GNU is to give all computer users the freedom of copying, developing, distributing, modifying and studying software with the understanding that its redistribution cannot be limited
     - WHY GNU project need to be started:
     - Every computer user needs an operating system; if there is no free operating system, then you can't even get started using a computer without resorting to proprietary software. So the first item on the free software agenda obviously had to be a free operating system
     - Combining Linux with the almost-complete GNU system resulted in a complete operating system: the **GNU/Linux system**. 
     - Estimates are that tens of millions of people now use **GNU/Linux systems**
     - Mục tiêu của dự án GNU là tạo ra được một hệ điều hành **giống Unix** và **miễn phí**  => GNU sẽ clone Unix và public miễn phí
     - Lý do mà GNU quyết đinh xây dựng 1 hệ điều hành giống Unix là để ng dùng Unix có thể dễ dàng chuyển sang hệ điều hành của
     
 - Linux is introduced by **Linus Torvalds**, a student in Finland.
 - **1972** Ritchie rewrote B and called the new language C. => 1972 C was borned
 - **1991** **Linux** is introduced by Linus Torvalds, a student in Finland. => 1991 Linux was borned
 - **1992** **GNU/Linux systems** was released under the GNU General Public License. => **GNU/Linux systems** = Linux + GNU
 - **2004** The first release of Ubuntu (baby of Linux OS) is released October 20, 2004.
