### Android Support Library 

----------------------------------------

### Android Support Library 
* **Current Android OS is 7.0 : API 25** but so much device in the world is **Android 4.0.3, 4.0.4 : API 15** 
* But `API 15` is so much less **classes, functions, features** than `API 25`, therefor you need **Android Support Library** to use some better functions and features in old devices
* **Android Support Library** just is a .aar or .jar file, that will build with your application (.apk)
* The Support Libraries provide additional **classes, function and features** not available in the standard Framework API for easier development and support across more devices
