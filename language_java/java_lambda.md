### Java Lambda Expressions

* **Java Lambda Expressions = Arrow function in JS or Anonymous function in JS**

* Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8.
* A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. 
* Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.


```java
() -> {  
//Body of no parameter lambda  
}


(p1) -> {  
//Body of single parameter lambda  
}  

(p1,p2) -> {  
//Body of multiple parameter lambda  
}  

```
