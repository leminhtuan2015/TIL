# 1. Overview

## What is the difference between **classpath in Java** and **build path in eclipse**?

  - **class path**  => Just for Java
    - 
    
  - **build path**  => Just For Eclipse
    - The Build Path is just an Eclipse thing.
    
    - It's where Eclipse finds the classes, .jar files needed to compile and run the classes of the project.
    
    - The build path is used when Eclipse is running/compiling a Java program.
    
  - **Java Web Application**
    - In the case of a webapp, the webapp runs inside a Java EE web container, all the file in WEB-INF/classes are automatically included in the classpath of the web app
