### __init__.py

* Files named **__init__.py** are used to **mark directories on disk as Python package directories**

* Python defines two types of packages: 
  * Regular packages
  * Namespace packages
  
* Regular packages are traditional packages as they existed in Python 3.2 and earlier.
* A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an __init__.py file.
* When a regular package is imported, this __init__.py file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines are bound to names in the packageâ€™s namespace.
* The __init__.py file can contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.
