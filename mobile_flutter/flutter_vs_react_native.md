### Flutter VS React Native


* Widgets are same to components in React Native. 
* Flutter comes with a large number of ready-to-use widgets, most of which implement the material design concepts. 
* There are two types of widgets, **stateless widgets**, and **stateful widgets**, just like **functional components** and **class components** in React.
  * **stateless widgets** = **functional components**
  * **stateful widgets** = **class components**
