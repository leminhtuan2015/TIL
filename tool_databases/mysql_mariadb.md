### MySQL vs MariaDB

* MariaDB is a fork of MySQL

#### MySQL
* **MySQL**: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Just like all other relational databases, MySQL uses tables, constraints, triggers, roles, stored procedures and views as the core components that you work with. A table consists of rows, and each row contains a same set of columns. MySQL uses primary keys to uniquely identify each row (a.k.a record) in a table, and foreign keys to assure the referential integrity between two related tables.

* MySQL: MySQL is written in C and C++

#### MariaDB
* **MariaDB**: Since **MariaDB is a fork of MySQL**, the database structure and indexes of MariaDB are the same as MySQL. This allows you to switch from MySQL to MariaDB without having to alter your applications since the data and data structures will not need to change.

* MariaDB: MariaDB is written in C, C++, Bash, and Perl
