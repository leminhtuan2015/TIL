### Why does DNS matter?
* The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is an important part of the web's infrastructure, 
serving as the Internet's phone book: every time you visit a website, your computer performs a DNS lookup.
Complex pagesrequire often  multiple DNS lookups before they start loading, 
so your computer may be performing hundreds of lookups a day.
