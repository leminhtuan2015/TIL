### Why does DNS matter?
* DNS = {Domain : IP}
* The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is an important part of the web's infrastructure, 
serving as the Internet's phone book: every time you visit a website, your computer performs a DNS lookup.
Complex pagesrequire often  multiple DNS lookups before they start loading, 
so your computer may be performing hundreds of lookups a day.

### Google Public DNS
Configure your network settings to use the IP addresses 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your DNS servers.
