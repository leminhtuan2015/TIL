### Virtual Private Network (VPN)


----------------------------------------------

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

* **YOU <-----> VPN <-----> INTERNET**
* VPN, like proxies, make your traffic appear as if it comes from a remote IP address.
* VPN encrypts all of your traffic (Proxy is Not), replacing your ISP and routing all traffic through the VPN server, 
* VPNs are set up at the **operating system level**, and the VPN connection captures the entire network connection of the device it is configured on.
* Enables users to **send and receive** data across **shared or public networks** as if their computing devices were directly connected to the Internet
* Anything you do on the internet, from checking your bank statements to gaming online, won't be seen by anyone **but** the VPN host server.
