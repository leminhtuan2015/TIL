### Why Python is the language of AI?

* **Simple and Consistent**
  * Machine learning is all about complicated algorithms and versatile workflows. So the simplicity of Python helps the developers to deal with the complex algorithms
  
  * Saves the time of developers as they only require concentrating on **solving the ML problems rather than focusing on the technicality of language**
  
* **Flexibility**
  * The imperative style
  * The Functional Style 
  * The Object-oriented Style
  * The procedural style
  
* **Libraries and Framework**

  * **Machine learning**: Keras, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn
  * **Advanced computing**: SciPy
  * **Data visualization**: Seaborn
  * **Data analysis**: Pandas for general-purpose
  * **Scientific computing and data analysis**: NumPy
  * **Computer vision**: OpenCV
  * **Natural language processing**: NLTK, spaCy
