### What is Machine Learning?

* **Computer Science -> Artificial Intelligence -> Machine Learning -> Deep Learning**

* **Machine learning**: is the technique to induce knowledge into the machine. Push knowledge into the machine, the system.

### What is Deep Learning?

* These are the actual methods to induce knowledge to the machine. Deep Learning is the one method for pushing knowledge to the machine
* Deep learning use Neural nets to mimic human brain and thus provide “brain like” organ to the machine.
* Machine can then use it to learn, remember and calculate(predict) stuff just like humans
