### Neural networks

* **Neural networks in AI is inspired by human brain**,  Neural networks programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data

### Deep Learning

* Deep learning is a set of techniques for learning in neural networks.
* Imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making.
* **Neural networks and deep learning** currently provide the best solutions to many problems in **image recognition**, **speech recognition**, and **natural language processing**

### Deep Learning Frameworks

* Google: Keras, TensorFlow
* Facebook: Caffe2, Pytorch
* Microsoft: CNTK
* Amazon: Mxnet
