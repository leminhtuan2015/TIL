--------------------------------------------------------------

### Unity Singleton Design Pattern
* Singleton is a basic Design Pattern. 
* Classes implementing Singleton pattern will ensure that only one instance of the object ever exists at any one time. 
* It is recommend using Singletons for things that do not need to be copied multiple times during a game.
* This is great for **controller classes like `GameManager` or `AudioController`**.
