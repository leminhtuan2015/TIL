### Theory of IT
### Theory of IT For?

### Programing languages will be designed for supporting some theory (Not all theories). 
  - For example 
    - Ruby-------->: 100% OOP
    - Javascript-->: OOP + FP
    - Swift------->: OOP + FP
    - Haskell----->: FB
    - Scala------->: OOP + FB

--------------------

### Theory of IT
  - **Software design pattern**
    - MVC
    - MVVM
    - MVP
  
  - **Programming paradigm**
    - OOP
    - FP
      - FP Pure
      - FP Impure
    
  - **Programming technique**
    - High Order Function
    - Pure function
    - First class function
    - ORM (Object Relationship Mapping)
    
  - **Web**
    - RESTFul (Representational state transfer)
    
  - **Compile type**
    - Compiled languages
    - Scripting languages
    - Interpreted languages
  

  
### Theory of IT For?
  - All is the theory in IT, those theory will be implemented by programing languages such as Java, C, Swift, Javascript, PHP ......
  - First you study well about theory after that you need a programing language to implement.
  - The theories can be apply for **Programing languages / Programing Framework**
  - *One* **Programing languages / Programing Framework** can be apply *many* theories
  - For example ROR framework is applying :
    - Use Ruby programing language
    - OOP in Ryby code
    - RESTful in design
    - ORM in ActiveRecord of ROR
