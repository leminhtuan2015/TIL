### Object Oriented Programming is Inherently Harmful

  - "Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California." – Edsger Dijkstra

  - "object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing." – Rob Pike

  - "The phrase "object-oriented" means a lot of things. Half are obvious, and the other half are mistakes." – Paul Graham

  - "Implementation inheritance causes the same intertwining and brittleness that have been observed when goto statements are overused.
As a result, OO systems often suffer from complexity and lack of reuse." – John Ousterhout Scripting, IEEE Computer, March 1998

  - "90% of the shit that is popular right now wants to rub its object-oriented nutsack all over my code" – kfx

  - "Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function." – John Carmack

  - "The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. 
You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle." – Joe Armstrong

  - "I used to be enamored of object-oriented programming. I’m now finding myself leaning toward believing that it is a plot designed to destroy joy." – Eric Allman

  - Object-orientation suggest that each object is responsible for itself. However, objects often have many references to 
other objects around them, and these references need to be kept consistent. Sometimes this results in some serious management 
problems when it is not clear which objects can or may manipulate the state of another object. Also the creation and destruction 
of objects always falls under the responsibility of other objects. It is especially hard to define consistent semantics in
manipulating complex object structures.
