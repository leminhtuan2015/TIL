### Basic Concepts
#### OOP vs FP
  - **Functional programming** is a form of **declarative programming**
  - **Object-oriented programming** primarily support **imperative (procedural) programming**
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as C#, Visual Basic, C++, and Java, were designed to primarily support imperative (procedural) programming
  
  - The functional programming paradigm was explicitly created to support a **pure functional** approach to problem solving.
  
  - **imperative programming (OOP)**, a developer writes code that describes in exacting detail the steps that the computer must take to accomplish the goal. This is sometimes referred to as algorithmic programming
  - **functional programming (FP)** involves composing the problem as a set of functions to be executed. You define carefully the input to each function, and what each function returns.
  - Although most languages were designed to support a specific programming paradigm, many general languages are flexible enough to support multiple paradigms
    - Such as : Javascript, Scala, Swift support both OOP and FP
  - For example, most languages that contain **function pointers** can be used to credibly support **functional programming**
