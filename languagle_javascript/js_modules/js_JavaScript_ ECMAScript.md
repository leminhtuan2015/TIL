### ECMAScript
### JavaScript

--------------------------------------------

### ECMAScript (is the theory)

* ECMAScript = ES:
* ECMAScript is a Standard for scripting languages.
* Languages like Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard.
* ECMA Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft).
* ECMA means European Computer Manufacturerâ€™s Association

### JavaScript (is the implementation of the ECMAScript)

* JavaScript = JS:
* JavaScript is the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript Standard.
* The core features of Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard,  but Javascript also has other additional features that are not in the ECMA specifications/standard.
* ActionScript and JScript are other languages that implement the ECMAScript.
* JavaScript was submitted to ECMA for standardization but due to trademark issues with the name Javascript the standard became called ECMAScript.
* Every browser has a JavaScript interpreter.
