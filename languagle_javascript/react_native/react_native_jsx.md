### JSX

* JSX = JS + XML, 

* React view layer = XML
* Web view layer = HTML
* Android view layer = XML
* IOS view layer = XML
  
* React Native is “just” JavaScript + XML
* React Native actually translates your markup (JSX) to real, native UI element
* The update cycle in React Native is the same as in React: when **props or state change**, React Native re-renders the
views.
                                                                                                                        
* React Native markup (JSX) is translated to suit the host platform, so a **<View>** might become an iOS-specific **UIView**.
 
* JSX combining markup and the JavaScript that controls it into a single file.
