### JSX

* JSX = JS + XML (Use can see **Javascript code + XML code** in a one file)

* With other Mobile Platform
  * Web view layer = HTML
  * Android view layer = XML
  * IOS view layer = XML
  
* And also : **React view layer = XML**
  
* React Native is "just" JavaScript + XML

* React Native actually **translates your markup (JSX) to real, native UI element**
  * **<View>** might become an iOS-specific **UIView**
  * **<Text>** might become an iOS-specific **Label**
  * ...

* The update cycle in React Native is the same as in React: when **props or state change**, React Native re-renders the
views.
                                                                                                                         
* JSX combining markup and the JavaScript that controls it into a single file.
