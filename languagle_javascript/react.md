------------------------------
#### What is difference between React native vs React JS?

* ReactJS is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications.
* React Native is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use ReactJS to build your components, and implements ReactJS under the hood.
* Both are open sourced by Facebook.

#### React Native
* React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript
* With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java
