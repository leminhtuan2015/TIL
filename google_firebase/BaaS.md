### Backend as a service (BaaS)
### Platform as a service (PaaS)

--------

### Technically minded
  - For those less technically minded, here's the analogy I use... If you want a sofa, you can certainly go to Home Depot, buy the wood, buy nails, buy a hammer, etc... and build a sofa. Or you could go to Ikea, get the pieces and have the satisfaction of "building" a sofa, with much of the hard work done.
  - If you value your time and don't want to re-solve problems that are already solved, go with a mBaaS

### Backend as a service (BaaS)
  - Mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), also known as "backend as a service" (BaaS)
  - BaaS is to visualize a bridge connecting the backend to the frontend of an application
  - BaaS providing a way to link ***their applications*** to ***backend cloud storage***
  - ***Web*** and ***mobile apps*** sometimes need to do works on the backend (long-time tasks, complicated tasks) => ***BaaS*** providers a bridge between the frontend of an application and backends cloud.
  - BaaS reduces a development teamâ€™s need to construct complex backend infrastructure
  - Each BaaS provider a different set of backend tools and resources.

### Platform as a service (PaaS)
