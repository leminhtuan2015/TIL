* In Blockchain Bitcoin system
  * Mining is **NOT** about creating new bitcoins. 
  * Mining is the mechanism that allows the blockchain to be a decencentralized security. 
  * Mining secures the bitcoin system and enable a system without a central authority
  
* In Blockchain system
  * Mining is finding the nonce
  * Mining is the computational process of caculating a certain **hash**
  * Mining is Making a **hash of the block** with some conditions (difficulty)
  
* Miners validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger ( blockchain )
* Miners receive a reward when they solve the complex mathematical problem. There are two types of rewards: new bitcoins or transaction fees (rewards can be other things, Must NOT be bitcoin)



### Min

 a block is mined by multiple nodes, but the first one that creates a valid proof of work 'wins'.. right? What happens with the computing power of all the other nodes working on the same solutions, was that 'useless' so to say?
