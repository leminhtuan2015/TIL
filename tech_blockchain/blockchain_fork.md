### Blockchain : Fork

--------------------------------------------------------

### Blockchain : Fork

* **Forks** are a natural occurrence during mining (occurrence when finding nonce to get a valid hÃ¡h of block)
* If there are more than one (exmple two) miner (following the same consensus rules) found the nonce and found the valid hash of block => both of that blocks will be add to the chain but we just can add one block and not other block => The blockchain resolve this problem by : after valid block added if which chain of blockhain is longger => that longger blockchain is keep and update that new chain for all node in blockchain network.
