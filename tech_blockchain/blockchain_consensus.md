### Blockchain Consensus
### Methods Of Finding Consensus In A Blockchain

--------------------------------------------------------

### Blockchain Consensus

* Blockchain Consensus is the algorithm to make blockchain security 

* Blockchain uses **distributed consensus** where multiple computers or nodes (Miner) approve these transactions based on mathematical calculations. All these nodes have to arrive at a consensus to approve or reject the transaction.

* **consensus** is a rule for all node (miner) to competitive find out the hash of block with the dificulty (finding nonce)


### Methods Of Finding Consensus In A Blockchain
* Proof-of-work algorithm(PoW)
* Proof-of-stake algorithm (PoS)
