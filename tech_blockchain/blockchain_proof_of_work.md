### Blockchain Proof Of Work

* **All node (miner) in blockchain network will competitive find the nonce**
* Proof Of Work: is the mechanism to **creat a new block in blockchain (and add new block to the chain)**
* In Bitcoin case, Proof Of Work take 10 minus
* Proof of work is a requirement that expensive computations, proof of work also called **mining**
* After a period of time if Proof Of Work take more or less time to find a valid the difficulty of blockchain will be modify to alway keep the block will be resolve in 10 minus.


### Blockchain Proof Of Stake

* **System will be randomly select any node (Miner) to resolve the block (find the nonce)**
* The way the system select is that
  * That node is online
  * That (node) miner have bigger current balance
  * ...
