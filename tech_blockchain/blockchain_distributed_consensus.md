### Blockchain Distributed Consensus

--------------------------------------------------------

### Blockchain Distributed Consensus

* Blockchain uses distributed consensus where multiple computers or nodes approve these transactions based on mathematical calculations. All these nodes have to arrive at a consensus to approve or reject the transaction. 

* This consensus mechanism is the biggest selling point of Blockchain. The details of how they approve, why they should approve, what happens if one of them disapprove for financial gains are some huge and heavy to digest topics in themself.
