### Docker architecture

------------------------------------------------

### Docker architecture

#### Docker Engine
* **Docker Engine** (Docker) is a client-server application with these major components:

  * **Docker server (Docker daemon)** which is a type of long-running program called a **daemon** process (the **dockerd** command).
  * **Docker REST API** which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.
  * **Docker command line interface (CLI)** client (the **docker** command).
  
* The **Docker daemon** (Docker server) creates and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

#### Docker architecture

* Docker uses a client-server architecture.
* The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon (Docker server), which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.
* The Docker client and Docker daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.
* The Docker client and Docker daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface

#### Docker server (Docker daemon)

* The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

#### The Docker client
* The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. 
* When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API.
* The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

#### Docker registries
* A Docker registry stores Docker images. 
* Docker Hub and Docker Cloud are public registries that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. 
* You can even run your own private registry. If you use Docker Datacenter (DDC), it includes Docker Trusted Registry (DTR).

* When you use the `docker pull` or `docker run` commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry.
* When you use the `docker push` command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.
