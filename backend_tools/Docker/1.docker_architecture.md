### Docker architecture

------------------------------------------------

### Docker architecture

#### Docker Engine
* **Docker Engine** (Docker) is a client-server application with these major components:

  * **Docker server (Docker daemon)** which is a type of long-running program called a **daemon** process (the **dockerd** command).
  * **Docker REST API** which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.
  * **Docker command line interface (CLI)** client (the **docker** command).
  
* The **Docker daemon** (Docker server) creates and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

#### Docker architecture

* Docker uses a client-server architecture.
* The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon (Docker server), which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.
* The Docker client and Docker daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.
* The Docker client and Docker daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface
