### Dockerfile
------------------------------------------------------------

### Docker objects
* Docker images
* Docker containers

#### Docker images

* In Docker, everything is based on Images. An image is a combination of a file system and parameters
* An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

```sh
# List the Docker images
docker image ls
docker images
```

#### Docker containers

* A container is a runtime instance of an Docker image, what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process). You can see a list of your running containers with the command, **docker ps**, just as you would in Linux.

* Docker images = The Class
* Docker containers = The object (instance of the Class)

```sh
# List the Docker containers
docker container ls
# OR
docker ps
```

### Dockerfile

* Use for build your own Docker image
