### Docker containers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Docker containers

* A container is a runtime instance of an Docker image, what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process). You can see a list of your running containers with the command, **docker ps**, just as you would in Linux.

* Docker images = The Class
* Docker containers = The object (instance of the Class)

```sh
# List the Docker containers
docker container ls
# OR
docker ps
```

### Dockerfile

* Define a container with Dockerfile
* **Dockerfile** defines what goes on in the environment inside your **Docker container**
