### GameObject
### Component


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GameObject
  * A GameObject contains components
  * Every object in your game is a GameObject
  * Depending on what kind of GameObject object you want to create, you add different combinations of components to a GameObject.
  * GameObject is just a empty container, We should add components to GameObject to create a complete GameObject

### Component
* When you create a script and attach it to a GameObject, the script appears in the GameObjectâ€™s Inspector just like a built-in component. This is because scripts become components when you save them in your project.
