----------------------------------------------------------

### Unity Canvas

* The Canvas is a Game Object with a Canvas component attached on it.
* The Canvas is the area that all **UI elements** should be inside
* All UI elements must be children GameObject of such a Canvas GameObject
* Creating a new UI element (such as an Image using the menu GameObject > UI > Image) automatically creates a Canvas, if there isnâ€™t already a Canvas in the scene.
