### Script API
  
  * In Android/IOS/Unity we have 2 ways for create a view component:
    * Drag-Drop ui component in storyboard/layout/Scene
    * Create programmatically by code
  
  * The same Android-Java or IOS-Swift, in Unity we can create components programmatically
  * We can create Button, Image, TextBox programmatically (by code) => With each component we have a class of it.
  * Each UI component is a class
    * IOS button = UIButton class
    * Android button = Button class
    * Unity button = UnityEngine.UI.Button
