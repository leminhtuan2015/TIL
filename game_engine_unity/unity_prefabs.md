### Unity Prefabs

---------------------------------------

### Unity Prefabs

* Unity has a Prefab asset type that allows you to store a GameObject object complete with components and properties. 
* The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. 
* Any edits made to a prefab asset are immediately reflected in all instances produced from it but you can also override components and settings for each instance individually.
