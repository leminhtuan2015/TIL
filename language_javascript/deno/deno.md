### What is Deno
* Deno is replacement of  Node.js
* Deno is a secure TypeScript runtime built on V8”

* About 3 months ago, Ryan Dahl (the inventor of Node.js) gave a talk in JSConf called “10 Things I Regret About Node.js”, were he regrets several design decisions he took over Node.js. 
* About during the half of his talk, he showed us an experimental prototype called Deno that aimed to fix Node.js problems.
* Deno has reached v0.1 and I think that it’s on the right way to replace Node.js in the future.
