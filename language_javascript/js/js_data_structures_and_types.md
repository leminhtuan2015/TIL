### Data structures and types

* JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
* That means you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it, and data types are converted automatically as needed during script execution

```
var answer = 42;

answer = 'Thanks for all the fish...';

=> Because JavaScript is dynamically typed, this assignment does not cause an error message.
