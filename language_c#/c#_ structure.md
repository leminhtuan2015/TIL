### C# Structure

* In C#, a structure is a **value type** data type. It helps you to make a single variable hold related data of various data types. The struct keyword is used for creating a structure.

```c#
struct Books {
   public string title;
   public string author;
   public string subject;
   public int book_id;
}; 
```
