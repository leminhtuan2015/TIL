* API is placed inside IOS/Android (OS)
* With each **version of IOS/Android (OS)** => **version of API** will be updated (add more or deprecated)
* Choosing a lower API level may support more devices but gain less functionality for your app. you may also work harder to achieve features you could've easily gained if you chose higher API level.
