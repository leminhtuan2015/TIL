### What is PHP?

* PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor)
* PHP is server-side script, PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client (browser).
* PHP is a scripting language that is **especially suited for web development**
* PHP can be embedded into HTML. All of the PHP code present in the Web page is processed and stripped from the page; the only thing returned to the client from the Web server is pure HTML output.

```php
<html>
   
   <head>
      <title>Hello World</title>
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <?php echo "Hello, World!";?>
   </body>

</html>
```
