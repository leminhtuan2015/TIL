### EC2

* EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud

* Overall you have three options for remote controlling an Ubuntu PC:
  * SSH: Secure Shell
  * VNC: Virtual Network Computing
  * RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol
  
* While many Linux users see SSH as their remote connection tool of choice, it lacks a graphical user interface (GUI)
