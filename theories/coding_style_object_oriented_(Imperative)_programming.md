---------------------
#### Basic
- Imperative (OOP): Write correct sequence of codes in the correct order. Step by step. Focus on solve problem by answer question how.
- Declarative (FP): Write code to describes what you want to do.

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

#### Abstraction
- Abstraction: The process of picking out (abstracting) common features of objects and procedures.

#### Class
- Class: A category of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.

#### Encapsulation
- Encapsulation: The process of combining elements to create a new entity. A procedure is a type of encapsulation because it combines a series of computer instructions.

#### Information hiding
- Information hiding: The process of hiding details of an object or function. Information hiding is a powerful programming technique because it reduces complexity.

#### Inheritance
- Inheritance: a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different classes.

#### Interface
- Interface: the languages and codes that the applications use to communicate with each other and with the hardware.

#### Messaging
- Messaging: Message passing is a form of communication used in parallel programming and object-oriented programming.

#### Object
- Object: a self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.

#### Polymorphism
- Polymorphism: A programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.

#### Procedure
- Procedure: a section of a program that performs a specific task.
